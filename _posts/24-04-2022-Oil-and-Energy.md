On July 26, 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) seized all Japanese assets in the US and imposed a strict oil embargo on the country. Britain and the Dutch East Indies – the colonial predecessor to modern-day Indonesia and a major oil supplier to Japan – quickly followed suit. Virtually overnight, Japan lost three quarters of its trade and nearly 90% of its oil imports. Faced with limited domestic oil inventory, minimal capacity for production, and few options beyond a humiliating surrender of their geopolitical aims to a hostile foreign power, Japan made the fateful decision to go to war with the US. The attack on Pearl Harbor a little more than four months later was driven by Japan’s ultimate need to occupy, defend, and exploit the energy bounty of the Dutch East Indies, which they proceeded to do a month after severely weakening the US forces in the Pacific.
