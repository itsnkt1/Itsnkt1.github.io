Oscillators such as Stochastics,RSI,ROC are important tools in the hands of a trader trading on technical analysis. But oscillators are generally used in a wrong way and the common reaction of traders is to sell if the oscillator goes into overbought zone and buy once it moves in oversold zone.  
  
The above is too simplistic way of trading with an oscillator....here we will discuss some nonconventional ways.....  
  
Best wishes for the " Oscillating Roller Coaster Journey

I would like to share an important phenomenon regarding oscillator overbought/oversold conditions. Whenever an oscillator like Stochastics,( or even RSI,ROC etc ) stays above the overbought limit for more than 5 bars without taking a dip from overbought to neutral zone....the market has a lot of steam left further to go up, market then continues upward journey,then comes down,then goes into overbought zone again but shows negative divergence and then only it comes down...till then it keeps making higher tops. This is a very strong bullish signal to trade.....

The market goes from overbought to oversold and so on so forth in a trading or sideways market environment...so selling in overbought and buying in oversold zone is a good strategy....but somewhere markets start trending and that is where the trouble starts for our traditional oscillator trader.

To understand the correct way of trading on oscillators let us study the **Nifty futures 60 min chart.** The stochastic oscillator is doing a great job till May 09end...calling each top and bottoms and our oscillator trader is on a high and feels that he has figured out everything in the markets and he is on his way to top the next batch of Market Wizards......But market has its own ways...we all know that....![;)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Wink    ;)"):lol:All of us have been there....  
  
The problem areas for the oscillator trader are as under :  
  
1) Up trending market from 27-5-09 ,1:00 bar to 2-6-09 ,11:00 bar  
  
2) Up trending market from 9-6-09 ,3:00 bar to 12-6-09 ,12:00 bar  
  
3) Down trending market from 12-6-09 ,3:30 bar to 16-06-09,12:00 bar  
  
4) Down trending market from 17-06-09 ,3;00 bar to 18-06-09 ,3:30 bar


If he can handle the above 4 markets successfully, our oscillator trader is the king....  
  
Let us see how he can handle these periods...I will explain first two cases,rest 2 are mirror images...  
  
**1) 27-05-09 ,1:00 bar onwards**.....  
  
On 27-5-09 at 1:00 bar the stochastic oscillator goes into overbought zone and that is a mouth watering trade for our trader friend to go short ( most will trade like this and repent later ). He goes short and gets killed in the subsequent market action.

The **Oscillator Entry Qualifiers For Short Trade** are as under :  
  
1) The oscillator should have gone to overbought zone.  
2) Wait for a bar where the oscillator flips...ie comes out of overbought zone and comes in neutral zone....  
3) In doing step No 2 the oscillator should not have stayed in overbought zone for 5 bars and more  
4) Wait for a downclose ( meaning close less than earlier day's close)  
5) Ensure that by that time oscillator does not go very near oversold region  
6) Sell when the low of the downclose bar is broken on downside.....  
  
If you observe all 6 qualifiers you will see that there was no shorselling opportunity in this uptrend.....our trader friend is home safely....and made money in longs....

**2) 9-6-09 ,3:00 Bar onwards**  
  
Oscillator went into overbought territory and stayed there for 9 bars.....so no shortselling ideas to be entertained....  
  
Here the market will move to neutral zone,dissipate the extra bullish pressure ,then go to overbought region,fulfill all 6 qualifiers,give negative divergence and then change its direction to down...let us see what it did...  
  
Come to 12-06-09 ,12:00 bar...after dipping into neutral territory the oscillator has gone to overbought zone again....it stayed there only for 1 bar.....next bar 1:00 it dips again into neutral zone,gives a downclose...Now all qualifiers satisfied...the low of the 1:00 bar cracked in 12-6-09 , 3:00 bar **and that is an ideal sell entry....mkt never looked up after that**Also note the classic negative divergence here,the mkt making new higher top oscillator making lower top....all perfect...  
  
The other two are mirror images in downtrend.Our friends can easily figure them out well .....  
  
Best wishes....
